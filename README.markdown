# Virtual Token #

Virtual Token is a simple webapp to manage mutexes for wetware. The primary use
case is as an integration token for software development teams.

At present, the app only supports the ability to create a named token and then
take or release that token. There is no authentication or queueing.

The goal is to add simple authentication and queueing that will allow someone to
"get in line" for the token and be alerted via SMS or email when it is their
turn.
